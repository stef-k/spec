## Summary
Add an AppShell entry named "My Groups" and scaffold `Pages/MyGroupsPage.xaml(.cs)` with a Mapsui map view container and top bar placeholders (Group button, Date button). No data wiring yet.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] AppShell shows a "My Groups" menu entry and navigates to `MyGroupsPage`.
- [ ] `MyGroupsPage` loads without errors; map displays base OSM tiles.
- [ ] Page contains visible Group and Date buttons (non-functional placeholders).

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add Shell route and menu item ("My Groups")
- [ ] Create `Pages/MyGroupsPage.xaml` and code-behind with `MapView`
- [ ] Wire basic map initialization (CRS, OSM layer)
- [ ] Build and verify navigation

## Verification
- Command: `dotnet build -c Debug`
- Manual: Launch app, open "My Groups"; confirm page loads and OSM renders.

## Notes
Re-use Timeline map init patterns for consistency.
