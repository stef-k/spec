## Summary
Add a date picker that quickly navigates year → month → day, always landing on a single day. For non-Today days, disable SSE and use `POST /locations/query` with the selected date.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Date UI allows fast switching and always returns an exact day.
- [ ] Non-Today uses historical query and renders markers; Today remains SSE-enabled.
- [ ] Switching dates updates the map and legend consistently.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Implement date UI with transitions (year→month→day)
- [ ] Wire query body with `dateType: "day"` and Y/M/D
- [ ] Disable SSE on non-Today

## Verification
- Manual: Switch between Today and a past date; observe SSE stop and data load via query.

## Notes
Reuse Timeline date formatting and UI cues where helpful.
