## Summary
On marker tap, show a modal with member identity (username + display name), member-local time (server-computed) and viewer-local time, address, lat/lon, and action buttons: Open in Google Maps, Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org geosearch), Share location.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Modal displays all fields and is visually consistent with Timeline/Trip UI.
- [ ] “Open in Google Maps” opens the correct coordinates.
- [ ] “Wikipedia” geosearch opens closest article on en.wikipedia.org.
- [ ] “Share location” opens platform share sheet with proper link.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Build modal layout and bind selected marker data
- [ ] Implement actions (reuse existing helpers where available)

## Verification
- Manual: Tap a marker; check both times and actions.

## Notes
Borrow patterns from Timeline and MainPage Trip sidebar actions.
