## Summary
Add viewport debounce for query calls, throttle SSE-driven UI updates, and present selection size confirmation when enabling many users (“Select All”).

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Viewport debounce reduces query calls during rapid pan/zoom.
- [ ] SSE UI updates are coalesced under burst conditions.
- [ ] Large selection triggers a confirmation prompt.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Implement debounce/throttle helpers
- [ ] Add selection count checks and confirmation

## Verification
- Manual: Rapidly pan/zoom; verify limited query calls via logs.
- Manual: Trigger bursts of SSE events; observe smoothed UI updates.

## Notes
Keep logic simple; avoid over-optimization.
