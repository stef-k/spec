## Summary
Add and use new `SettingsStore` keys to persist last-selected group id and legend expanded/collapsed state. Optionally consider last date but default to Today.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] `MyGroups_LastSelectedGroupId` read/write works across sessions.
- [ ] `MyGroups_LegendExpanded` persists bottom sheet state.
- [ ] No regressions to existing settings events.

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] Add keys and accessors in `SettingsStore`
- [ ] Integrate reads on page load and writes on change

## Verification
- Manual: Change legend state; restart app; confirm persistence.

## Notes
Follow naming and event patterns used by existing settings.
