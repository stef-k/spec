## Summary
Add focused tests where feasible and finalize verification steps. Cover color mapping stability, SSE line parser resilience, and date query shaping. Provide manual E2E checklist.

## Acceptance Criteria (measurable)
- [ ] Color mapping unit test passes for a fixed set of usernames.
- [ ] SSE parser handles comment/heartbeat and data frames.
- [ ] Date shaping builds correct request bodies (day Y/M/D).

## Steps
- [ ] Read inputs
- [ ] If test project exists, add tests; otherwise, document manual steps and defer test scaffolding
- [ ] Run build/tests; capture logs

## Verification
- Commands (if tests exist): `dotnet test`
- Manual: Follow E2E checklist (multi-user live updates, offline/online, large selection)

## Notes
Do not add heavyweight test infrastructure if the project has none.
